# Speeding Up `petalinux-build`

Authored by ChatGPT (OpenAI), June 2025

`petalinux-build` is a powerful tool, but it can be quite slow. Below are practical strategies to significantly **speed it up**, depending on your workflow and system configuration.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Only Build What You Need

Use scoped targets instead of rebuilding the entire system every time:

- **Only build the kernel**:
  ```bash
  petalinux-build -c kernel
  ```

- **Only build the device tree**:
  ```bash
  petalinux-build -c device-tree
  ```

- **Only build the rootfs**:
  ```bash
  petalinux-build -c rootfs
  ```

- **Only build a specific app or component**:
  ```bash
  petalinux-build -c <your-app-name>
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Use More Cores

You can parallelize the build:

```bash
petalinux-build -v --jobs 8 --load-average 8
```

Or configure `conf/local.conf`:
```conf
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "8"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j8"
```

Tune according to your system‚Äôs CPU.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Use `sstate-cache` and `downloads` Sharing

Avoid rebuilding from scratch:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/petalinux/sstate-cache
mkdir -p ~/petalinux/downloads
```

Then add to `project-spec/meta-user/conf/petalinuxbsp.conf`:

```conf
SSTATE_DIR ?= "/home/youruser/petalinux/sstate-cache"
DL_DIR ?= "/home/youruser/petalinux/downloads"
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Avoid Rebuilding the Boot Components

If only the bitstream has changed:

1. Replace `.bit` in `images/linux/`
2. Run:
   ```bash
   petalinux-package --boot --fpga <your.bit> --u-boot
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Avoid Clean/Rebuild Unless Necessary

These commands clear useful caches and can greatly increase build time:

```bash
petalinux-build -x mrproper
petalinux-build -x cleansstate
```

Use them only if necessary.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Use a Fast SSD and Plenty of RAM

- A **fast NVMe SSD** significantly reduces I/O time.
- **16‚Äì32 GB RAM** prevents swap thrashing and speeds up parallel jobs.

---

## üß™ Advanced Options

- Use a **build server** with shared `sstate-mirror` and `DL_DIR`
- Run in **Docker** on a fast **cloud instance**
- Use **Ubuntu LTS** for better compatibility and performance

Let me know your change pattern (e.g. kernel tweaks, device tree edits, bitstream updates), and I can recommend a more tailored workflow.
